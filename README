# Solidity Wallet
*WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS* – This is just a developer playground.

This is the solution to the exercise in the [wallet.pdf](wallet.pdf).

It implements a basic wallet for ether and tokens. It also allows users to deposit funds. The wallet contract can be upgraded since we use a proxy contract that holds the funds. (not tested for security and stability)
